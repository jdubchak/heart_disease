## Introduction
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately $\frac{1}{4}$ of all deaths in the US are caused by heart disease [(source)](https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fs_heart_disease.htm). Many risk factors for heart disease are well documented, including the influence of diet and lack of physical activity. These features could be used to build a model to predict the presence or probability of an individual being diagnosed with heart disease, leading to early treatment and an improved quality of life. 

## The Data
The processed heart disease data used in this report were [downloaded](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease) from the University of California Irvine machine learning repository. The data sets for Cleveland, Hungary, Long Beach, and Switzerland, each contain a subset of 14 of the original 76 features, and are intended for classification. The outcome is a multiclass label ranging from 0 (no heart disease) to 4, and the values of 1,2,3, and 4 reflect the presence of heart disease.
